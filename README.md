# Flashcards App

This project is created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and connected to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), where available flashcards are stored. Firebase credentials are not shared on Github. To enable running this app locally without credentials I have provided mockup of 4 flashcards, so is is possible to run it locally even without using real database. ðŸŽ‰

The main goal of this project it to create flexible flashcards monorepo using [Nx](https://nx.dev/), to create different flashcards applications basing on pre-defined templates.

ðŸŸ¢ DEMO: Application is hosted on Firebase for demo purposes like a recruitment process. If you would like to see it please ask me for the link. ðŸ˜Š
